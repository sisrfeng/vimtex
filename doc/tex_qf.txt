*g:vimtex_quickfix_enabled*
    Use this option to disable/enable the quickfix integration.
    Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_quickfix_method*
    This option sets the quickfix method. The following methods are available:

    latexlog
        This is the standard method which parses the normal LaTeX output.

    pplatex
        Uses `pplatex` (https://github.com/stefanhepp/pplatex) to parse the LaTeX  output file.
        `pplatex` is a command line utility used to prettify the
        output of the LaTeX compiler.

    pulp
        Uses `pulp` (https://github.com/dmwit/pulp) to parse the LaTeX output  file,
        similar to `pplatex`.

    `pplatex` and `pulp` require that `-file-line-error` is NOT passed to
    the LaTeX  compiler.
    if one uses `latexmk` through  VimTeX.
        |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| will be updated automatically

    if one uses other compiler methods,
        either through  VimTeX (see |g:vimtex_compiler_method|)
        or externally,
        this requirement must be ensured by
        the user.

    Default value: 'latexlog'

*g:vimtex_quickfix_blgparser*
    This option controls the parsing of `blg` log files
    (created by bibtex or  biber) for warnings and errors.
    The option is a dictionary with the
    following keys:

        disable
            Disable the parsing of `blg` entries.

    Default value: {}

*g:vimtex_quickfix_autojump*
    Thus I recommend to keep it disabled for continuous compilation,
    and rather enable it if one prefers single shot compilations.

    Default value: 0

    This option controls if vim should automatically jump to the first error
    whenever the |quickfix| window is opened.

    This option does not go well with continuous compilation and  callbacks,
    since the callbacks will open the quickfix window if there are errors.


*g:vimtex_quickfix_ignore_filters*

    This option allows to provide a list of |regular-expression|s for filtering out undesired errors and
    warnings.
    This works regardless of which
    quickfix method is enabled.


    The following example will ignore any messages that match "Marginpar on  page":


        let g:vimtex_quickfix_ignore_filters = [
                    \ 'Marginpar on page',
                    \]

    Default: []

*g:vimtex_quickfix_mode*
    This option controls the behaviour of the |quickfix| window in case errors
    and/or warnings are found.  The recognized options are:

    Value  Effect
    0      The quickfix window is never opened/closed automatically.
    1      The quickfix window is opened automatically when there are errors,
                    and it becomes the active window.
    2      The quickfix window is opened automatically when there are errors,
                    but it does not become the active window.

    The quickfix window will only be opened automatically if the compiler
                is set to `continuous` mode and has `callbacks` enabled, or if
                `continuous` mode is disabled.

    Default value: 2

*g:vimtex_quickfix_autoclose_after_keystrokes*
    If set to value greater than zero, then the quickfix window will close after
    this number of motions (i.e. |CursorMoved| and |CursorMovedI| events). This
    is most useful if one sets |g:vimtex_quickfix_mode| to 2, in which case this
    option allows one to continue editing and removing the distraction of the
    quickfix window automatically.

    The count is reset when the quickfix window is entered.

    Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_quickfix_open_on_warning*
    Control whether or not to automatically open the |quickfix| window in case
    there are warning messages and no error messages.

    Default value: 1
